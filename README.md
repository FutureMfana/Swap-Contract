# Swap-Contract
A swap contract between two users where the smart contract knows who the Attacher is. The exchange is done with network tokens.  Participant A tells the contract who participant B is. The address should be stored in a Map or Set. Your contract should then check who the attacher is and only allow the swap if the addresses match.
